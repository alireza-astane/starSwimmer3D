# Star Swimmer 3D

This repository contains the code and analyses for the 3D Star Swimmer Project, carried out under the supervision of Dr. Mohammadreza Ejtehadi at Sharif University of Technology. The project investigates the dynamics of microswimmers in low Reynolds number fluids via numerical simulations, using models based on the Oseen tensor and the Navier–Stokes equations.

## Microswimmers Dynamics in Low Reynolds Number Fluids

At low Reynolds numbers, inertia is negligible compared to viscous forces. This regime is characteristic of microswimmers, where locomotion is achieved by cyclic deformations, such as sequences of contractions and expansions. The force balance is dominated by viscous drag, requiring swimmers to execute non-reciprocal (asymmetric) motions to induce net displacements.

## Oseen Tensor and Navier–Stokes for Swimmers

- **Oseen Tensor**  
  The Oseen tensor describes the effect of a point force in a viscous fluid. It is used here to compute the hydrodynamic interactions between different parts of the swimmer. In [phase1.ipynb](phase1.ipynb), numerical solutions for the Oseen tensor and swimmer dynamics are presented.

- **Navier–Stokes Equations**  
  For microswimmers, the simplified version of the Navier–Stokes equations (due to low Reynolds number) is used. In this regime, the equations reduce to a balance between pressure gradients and viscous stresses, which is essential for modeling the fluid’s response to the swimmer’s motion.
